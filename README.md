Tier 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Create a GitHub repository. Start from scratch or use the template provided by your instructor.

AS A USER (NOT LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Access the website via the Internet so I can browse and read reviews.
View details for a specific reviewed item (store, restaurant, product, book, etc.)
I should be able to see the item’s average score or rating.
I should be able to see any relevant information about the item.
Search for specific items, so I can see their scores and read reviews about them.
Sign up for an account so I can have a logged-in experience.
Log in to the site if I already have an account.
AS A LOGGED-IN USER, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Write and submit a review for an item that includes:
A written text review
A score/rating
Only one review should be allowed per item, per user
View a list of all reviews I have written.
Delete reviews I have written.
Edit reviews I have written.
Change the text review.
Modify the score/rating.
Write comments on reviews written by others.
View a list of all comments I have written.
Edit and delete my comments.
AS AN ENGINEER, I SHOULD:
Have a well-seeded database so that I can simulate several different scenarios for the user stories below.
By doing this, you set yourselves up to tackle many of the points throughout the tiers. In the long run, this will potentially save you tons of time.
For example, seed hundreds of items and reviews with dummy data so that when you get to the “pagination” user story, you won’t have to worry about adding more.
Also, add a bunch of users with reviews so the review editing features can be worked on without already having the “write a review” functionality built.
Have secured user data so that no one can unrightfully manipulate information.

TIER 2: Review Site Essentials
AS A USER (NOT LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Search or filter items by category.
Enjoy an aesthetically pleasing website that is intuitive and easy to use (UI/UX).
Be able to use all website features whether I am using a phone, tablet, or laptop/desktop computer.
Navigate the website successfully regardless of disability.
This is a great opportunity to dive into ADA Compliance (screen-reader friendliness, keyboard navigation, colorblind-friendly, etc.).
Resources: A11y ChecklistLinks to an external site., WebAIM Contrast CheckerLinks to an external site.
Know when content is loading, or there is an error so that I can manage my expectations.
Examples:
Show loading indicators while the frontend is waiting for a backend response.
If I visit an item page that does not exist, notify me and display a link to go to a list of all items.
AS A LOGGED-IN USER, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Add one or more images when writing or editing a review.
View and edit my user profile so I can update my information when necessary.
“Report” an item or review for inaccurate or inappropriate content.
Claim ownership of a reviewed item, i.e., “I own this restaurant,” or “I wrote this book,” etc.
Edit information on items I own.
Respond to comments on that item as the owner.
AS AN ADMINISTRATOR, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
View a list of all reviewed items.
Add, edit, and remove reviewed items.
Normal users should not have this ability.
Two REQUIRED pieces of information for each item:
Category or Tag:
For example:
Restaurants might be tagged as burger, pizza, Indian, Chinese, etc.
Books might fall under sci-fi, romance, mystery, etc.
Picture:
At least one picture representing the item (restaurant photo, book cover, etc). This can be a link to a picture hosted either on your site or elsewhere on the Internet.
Administrators should be able to add and modify relevant information on an item. It is up to you to decide what information is relevant, necessary, or otherwise. For example:
Books might have Title, Author, ISBN, Publisher, Published Date, Edition, and Language, where all fields except Title and Author are optional.
Restaurants might have Name, Address, Phone Number, Website, Instagram Account, and Operating Hours, where all fields except Name and Address are optional.
View a list of all users.
The administrator view for each user should include the users’:
Role (user or administrator)
Email address (should be unique)
Any other relevant information (name, review count, etc.)
Mark users as being owners of a reviewed item.
Receive requests that a user has claimed ownership of an item and approve or reject the request.
Assign users ownership of an item with or without a request.
Only one user can own any given item.
Have access to a dashboard with the following functionality:
Categories:
Create, edit, remove, and manage categories

Create, edit, remove, and manage items
View reports on items and manage them:
Dismiss them with no action
Approve them by modifying or removing the reported item

Users:

Remove users.

TIER 3: Extra Features
AS A LOGGED-IN USER, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Log in through third-party authentication to avoid creating an account specific to the website. For example, Google OAuth.
Add other users as co-owners of an item with the same permissions as me.
“Follow” other users so I can:
View them all in one place on the site.
Easily navigate to and view their profiles, where I can find:
Their detailed information
Their reviews and comments
Their followers and followed users
View my followers and followed users.
Receive notifications, either by email or on the site, for the following actions or events:
A review submitted on an item I own
A comment on a review I wrote
A user followed me
View items and reviews in a more user-friendly way:
More advanced search and filter options
Pagination
Infinite scrolling, i.e., more items appear when you scroll to the end of the page.
Receive recommendations for items based on my reviews.
For example, if I review a science fiction book, I might get a notification to check out another science fiction book.
